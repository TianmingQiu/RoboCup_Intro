\begin{abstract}
RoboCup is a competition for soccer robot held annually, which aims at promoting researches on robot and artificial intelligence. We work on the RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) by using humanoid robot NAO, based on the code framework from University of Bremen's team BHuman.

Self-localization is a very important task for NAO during the game. The action decisions, ball tracking and different team cooperation strategies are dependent on the precise location on the standard soccer field. Self-localization is also related computer vision and statistical signal processing. These topics are the foundations of autonomous robot. So this semester I focus on figuring it out, how does NAO localize itself on the soccer field by cameras and how could it be improved.

The current method in BHuman framework has been continuously developed, verified and implemented for several years and it has been considered as state-of-the-art method which is already very robust and compact. The main idea is to apply particle filter to estimate robot pose. But there are still some issues that when robot is walking, some shake noises from camera will cause deviations in visual odometry.

\markright{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
I would like to express my thanks to Prof. Dr. Gordon Cheng and Chair of Cognitive Systems for offering this course and all the hardware support.

I would further like to thank our supervisor Mohsen Kaboli for your patient help and many constructive suggestions. You are always willing to share your experiences and give us significant guide. Your office is always open for us.
I would also appreciate the help offered by our teaching assistant Zhiliang Wu, who prepared all the lab stuff fur us and wrote detailed tutorial that let me know how to operate NAO step by step. Your careful work make me get start quickly and give me a lot confidence to finish the task. 

I am particularly thankful to my team mate: Yao, Fabian, Zhiyi, Jingjie, and Minkai. We discussed a lot and you always give me some useful supports.
